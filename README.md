# FlamingoTask2 

This project demonstrates the use of the Youtube API to retrieve the top 100 influencers in the beauty category, which have been selected based on the criteria mentioned in the FlamingoTask2 document on Google Drive. <br> <br> The framework can be extended to include other API's such as the Facebook Graph API and Instagram API as well. <br> <br> Note: The program will ask for the authentication of your Youtube account as some of the functions of the API require OAuth 2.0 authentication with a user account. <br> <br> <b>Reference</b> <br> Youtube API v3 documentation and samples.
